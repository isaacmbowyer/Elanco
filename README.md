Re-design form for Elanco by Group 9. 

Isaac did Personal, Pet and Address details and the progress bar sytles.
Joe did Review and Submit and Create Account.
Alisha did Login System and Veiw Details.
Jacob did Rebate Process.
All Team members worked on styles

Isaac Uploaded their work on github (as evidenced) however other team members did not upload their work on github and sent code via zip files.
